# Puzzmo Frontend Interview starter project

### Introduction

This project is a simple React app that fetches the first page of results for Puzzmo's monthly total score leaderboard, using the Puzzmo GraphQL API, and displays the results in a list.

Relevant types that mirror the Graph QL schema are in the [`puzzmo-types.d.ts`](/src/puzzmo-types.d.ts) file.

This repo was bootstrapped with [`pnpm create vite`](), using the [`react-swc-ts`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) template.


### Installation
