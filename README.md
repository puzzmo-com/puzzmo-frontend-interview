# Puzzmo Frontend Interview starter project: Puzzmo monthly top scorers

### Introduction

Welcome to Puzzmo monthly top scorers: a React app that fetches the first page of results from Puzzmo's Monthly total score leaderboard and displays the results in a list. It uses the Puzzmo GraphQL API to fetch the data.

Relevant TypeScript types that mirror Puzzmo's GraphQL schema are in [`puzzmo-types.d.ts`](/src/puzzmo-types.d.ts).

This repo was bootstrapped with [`pnpm create vite`](https://vitejs.dev/guide/), using the [`react-swc-ts`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) template.

Further project instructions will be provided during the interview.

### Installation
